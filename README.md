# toDoList

Welcome to the `todolist` project. 

## ***Basic insight***

This is a simple project using `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`. 

This todolist comprises of two fields a title and description. To keep it simple all the data is stored in a cookie so you can always reopen the page locally on your computer to gain access to your list.

Infront of the Title on each task are two arrow buttons. These buttons allow you the ability to move a task up and down the list according to priority.

## ***Using the todolist***

### Creating a task
When you open the `todolist` page, if there are no tasks currently avaliable you will see a message on the screen saying "Your personal TO DO List!". You can add your first take by using the add `button` in the nav bar. Once you have clicked on this button a simple modal will appear where you can entry the information about your task (Title, Description) and two `buttons` (Cancel, Add).

If you fail to provide a title before clicking the add `button` an error message will appear prompting you to add one.

On completion of the fields in the modal, click the add `button` to add your task.

## Removing a task
If you add a task that you decide you no longer need you can remove it will a click of a button. 

Each task has its own red Bin button in the bottom right. Once clicked a `prompt` message will appear asking if you are sure you want to delete this item. 

`Note: once an item is deleted it is not retrieable.`

## Adjusting tasks due to priority

When a new task is created it is naturally appended to the bottom of the list.

To move it up and down the list, you can click the up and down arrows. When clicked it will move that task one place either up or down. 

## Saving your tasklist

This tasklist uses cookies to automatically save your list. 

The cookie will update when something is changed from removing a task or moving it up and down your list.

## ***Latest News***

This is now the old version. Work has started on a new one that is created using `OOP`. 

It will contain features like adding projects so you can have multiple lists, and a update UI.

You can check out the new one whilst it is in construction: [to_do_list](https://github.com/andyMa5on/to_do_list)
